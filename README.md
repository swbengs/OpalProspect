# OpalProspect
Public repository for Opal Prospect, a 3D visualizer for Dwarf Fortress.

This project is to allow you to save fortress info from a LUA script, and then keep that forever. It will allow you to save it at 
embark, anytime during your play session, and whenever you feel the fortress is done. You will be able to see how the fort grew.
Currently I am still working on the draw engine and next release(0.2) will be able to grab information from DFHack. 0.2 is coming out once the few remaining soil and stone textures are completed.

Currently it is designed to be built in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. I want to add support for CMake later so it can easily be built on other platforms.

# Thank you to DFHack, GLEW, GLFW, GLM, LibPNG, and ZLib for their open source code. Without you and your teams, none of this would be possible! Also big thanks to Tarn Adams and his brother for making Dwarf Fortress!
