# OpalProspect
Public repository for Opal Prospect, a 3D viewer for Dwarf Fortress.

This project is to allow you to save fortress info from a LUA script, and then keep that forever. It will allow you to save it at 
embark, anytime during your play session, and whenever you feel the fortress is done. You will be able to see how the fort grew.
Currently I am still working on the draw engine, and no support is yet available to grab information from DFHack.

### Info about how to write code is currently in code format.md.

### Info about the current design is in design.md.

### Info on building is in build.md

### Info on running is in run.md

## MIT license. Include in all files just to be safe. Stored in LICENSE.md

Currently it is designed to be built in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. I want to add support for CMake later so it can easily be built on other platforms.
