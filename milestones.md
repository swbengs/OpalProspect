# Milestones
This file describes major goal posts and what release version number it will corrospond with.

Version | Major feature(s)
------- | ----------------
0.08 | Basic lighting with just a simple directional light and diffuse coloring. Per vertex normals for the time being.
0.09 | Ability to use the already created list to load image files. Have a way to make it work even with most of them missing. No more manually typing the full path for files :)
0.099 | Create interesting hardcoded map to be used to show off version 0.10(blocks and floors only)
0.1(first release) | Draw engine basically finished. Able to draw a map built in memory/hardcoded
0.15 | Reading map from hand made files. Prototyping of 0.2 format for blocks and floors.
0.2(second release) | First ability to draw a map taken from DF and DFHack. Only floors and blocks. Designed for 1x1 embarks only.
0.22 | Optimizations to get ready for future releases and dealing with 48x300x48 size chunks up to 4x4 for sure. In particular face merging and voxel grid.
0.24 | Ramps and all their issues.
0.25 | Basic shadow map, which I have done before.
0.26 | Add water and lava. Requires transparency which I have not done before.
0.3(third release) | Next big update to LUA scripts to allow for water, and ramps to be read and written. And anything else added prior to 0.3. Some like ramps may get mini update prior to this big release. By this version I hope to have all 232 image files done.
0.4 | Contructions such as walls and fortifications.
0.5 | Add more things that are saved and drawn such as workstations and trees.
0.6+ | Keep adding things that can be drawn, hopefully with others creating and texturing models.
1.0 | Full release. May never get to this point.
