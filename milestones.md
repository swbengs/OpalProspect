# Milestones
This file describes major goal posts and what release version number it will corrospond with.

Version | Major feature(s)
------- | ----------------
0.08 | Basic lighting with just a simple directional light and diffuse coloring. Per vertex normals for the time being.
0.09 | Ability to use the already created list to load image files. Have a way to make it work even with most of them missing. No more manually typing the full path for files :)
0.99 | Create interesting hardcoded map to be used to show off version 0.10(blocks and floors only)
0.1(first release) | Draw engine basically finished. Able to draw a map built in memory/hardcoded
0.12 | Optimizations to get ready for 0.2 and dealing with 48x300x48 size chunks up to 4x4 for sure
0.14 | Ramps and all their issues.
0.15 | Basic shadow map, which I have done before.
0.2 | First ability to draw a map taken from DF and DFHack. Only terrain and liquids. No constructions(walls, workshops, and so on).
0.21 | Add water and lava. Requires transparency which I have not done before.
0.3 | Contructions such as walls and fortifications.
0.4 | Add more things that are saved and drawn such as workstations and trees.
0.5+ | Keep adding things that can be drawn, hopefully with others creating and texturing models.
1.0 | Full release. May never get to this point.
