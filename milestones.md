This file describes major goal posts and what release version number it will corrospond with.

Version | Major feature(s)
------- | ----------------
0.1 | Draw engine basically finished. Able to draw a map built in memory/hardcoded
0.11 | Basic shadow map, which I have done before.
0.15 | Add water and lava. Requires transparency which I have not done before.
0.2 | First ability to draw a map taken from DF and DFHack. Only terrain and liquids. No constructions(walls, workshops, and so on).
0.3 | Contructions such as walls and fortifications.
0.4 | Add more things that are saved and drawn such as workstations and trees.
0.5+ | Keep adding things that can be drawn, hopefully with others creating and texturing models.
1.0 | Full release. May never get to this point.
