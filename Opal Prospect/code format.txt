Convetions:

C code should have .h and .c file extensions
C++ code should use .hpp and .cpp file extensions

Coordinate handedness:
All code is to be written as left handed. All matrix assume this is the case. Old style OpenGL switched to right hand for the perspective
matrix, but I want to stay consistent the entire way.
Therefore, once again everything is written for left hand. +X is right, +Y is up, +Z is heading out from the camera.
