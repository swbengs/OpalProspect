This document is an overview of what's been done and what still needs to be done. Try to keep this about general topics and not specifics.
This is to help give an idea what needs to be done and what is currently being worked on. Further below I go into specifics about what is being done and why.

Updated: 6/1/2018

-=Draw engine specifics=-
OpenGL 3.3
Array Textures(Finished)
Indexed models aka gl draw elements(good progress)
Basic shadow maps(not started)

-=Dwarf Fortress stuff=-
LUA script to extract map info(not started)
Way of reading in file created by LUA script into visualizer(not started)
Textures for all terrain types(started but only barely) See the screenshots included and the 8x12 pixel copies from DF. Re draw as 16x16 pixel textures.

-=Current WIP(s)=-
1: Finishing model drawing automation. Currently you can load them in and fill in the model POD to draw, but it should all be filled in
by the system.
2: Getting most of the test world's map textures placed correctly for first attempt at drawing the world
3: Write ArrayTextureController to be simlar to model controller.


-==Specifics==-
-=Finishing model drawing automation=-
Currently can look up with model name which VAO it exists in. Need to be able to store and lookup textures by name as well. Should be able
to use the name only, and not the full path. Requires rewritting ArrayTexture.cpp a little and adding a texture controller.

Need VAO reference, texture reference, which is their opengl binding location, and the index offset and count of indicies. The offest refers to
that specific VAO only. Since a model can contain any number of them we must save this location and have a way to look it up. With these
we can draw any model on command. The other info is just there for help, errors, and debuging.
