Class to load and store a texture that is array of textures. 256 max supported z depth with OpenGL 3.3. 4.0+ adds support for 1024 or more I believe. Also can load multiple files and combine them into a single array texture as long as they all
share the same individual size. Instead of a texture atlas, one big image that you divide with texture coordinates, you have lots of smaller textures of the same size. Such as 16x16px
