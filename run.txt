This file describes how to run the program once it is built.

You need all the .dll files, .png files, and arrayTexture.frag and arrayTexture.vert

Full list below. All files come with the project. 

arrayTexture.frag, arrayTexture.vert, glew32.dll, glfw3.dll, libpng16.dll, zlib.dll, the Textures folder(leave everything as is inside it) and your .exe file. It should run just fine now.
